# Notes (Jessica's Handoff... sort of)

Okay so I'm leaving faster than expected (got an offer I couldn't refuse!) so here's everything I can think of. Sorry for the mess!

## Urgent Stuff
- Regional director wants Q3 report by month-end - USE THE TEMPLATE from the shared drive
- App notification system is glitchy again, IT ticket #7834
- Need to follow up with vendor about app redesign quote
- Point calculations are off for group classes - manual fix until dev team patches it

## Random Thoughts
- Why don't members care about the tiers?? We spent forever on the names
- Maybe better rewards? But budget is maxed out
- Planet Fitness has challenges and competitions, should we try that?
- The CFO keeps asking for ROI numbers, I never nailed down the calculation

## Campaign Ideas I Never Finished
Check the old-campaigns folder, there's about 10 things in there. Some might be salvageable. The double points weekend worked okay. The social media challenge was a total flop.

## What I Learned (for what it's worth)
- People download the app because front desk staff push it during onboarding
- They open it once or twice and forget about it
- Points don't motivate anyone unless they're really close to a reward
- The tier names mean nothing to members (Bronze? Silver? Nobody cares)

## Weird Idea I Never Had Time For
What if we helped people discover their fitness personality? Like a quiz or something. "Are you a Cardio Warrior or a Zen Yogi?" Could be motivating. Never had bandwidth to explore it. Probably silly anyway.

## Data Stuff
- member-data-summary.csv has the basics
- For deeper analytics, talk to the data team (ask for Ryan)
- Dashboard login is in the password manager

## Member Feedback
There's 4 months of feedback summaries in the member-feedback folder. TL;DR: people think it's "okay." Not terrible, not exciting. Just... okay. That's probably our issue.

## Competitor Notes
I researched Planet Fitness, 24 Hour Fitness, LA Fitness, and a couple boutique studios. In the competitor-research folder. Planet Fitness is killing it with their app. The boutique studios do the community thing really well. We're stuck in the middle doing neither.

## Passwords & Logins
- Ask IT for dashboard access
- Social media accounts are in the password manager
- Email platform login is membercare@fithubwellness.com

## People Who Can Help
- Mike (your boss) - generally supportive, under pressure from above
- Sandra (operations) - knows where everything is
- Ryan (analytics) - can pull any data you need
- Carlos (head trainer at downtown location) - gives great member perspective

## Sorry this is chaotic
I really tried to organize everything but ran out of time. The program isn't dead but it's not thriving. Someone just needs to figure out why members don't engage. That's the real challenge.

If you crack it, let me know? I'm genuinely curious what the answer is.

P.S. - The fitness personality quiz idea keeps bugging me. Maybe there's something there. Or maybe I just wanted to make a Buzzfeed-style quiz. Who knows.
