## The Key Insight

Boutique studios succeed because they give members an **identity**, not just a workout. You're not just "someone who goes to yoga" - you're "a CorePower person." That identity drives engagement.

Their apps reflect this - they're not about points or tiers. They're about being part of a tribe.

## Member Quotes (from our surveys mentioning boutiques)
> "At SoulCycle, I feel like I'm part of something special"

> "The app makes me feel connected to the studio even when I'm not there"

## Jessica's Key Question
How do we create that sense of identity and belonging in an app? We have community in our gyms - why doesn't that translate digitally?
