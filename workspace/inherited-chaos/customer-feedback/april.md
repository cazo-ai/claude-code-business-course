### In-Gym Comments (from trainer reports)

- Eastside location: "Member today said 'I wish this felt more like FitHub and less like a corporate gym app'"
- Member suggestion: "What if you helped people discover their workout personality?"
- Trainer observation: "Members get excited talking about their fitness preferences but the app ignores all that"
- Regular member: "I've been coming here a year but the app doesn't know anything about me"

### NPS Score This Month
- NPS for FitHub overall: 71 (strong)

### One Comment That Stuck With Me
> "Your gym has personality. Your rewards program doesn't. Fix that and you'd have something special."

## Summary
April was rough. The disconnect between how people feel about FitHub (positive) and FitRewards (meh) is glaring. Members want something that feels like US, not like generic visit tracking. The phrase "fine but forgettable" has now appeared three times. That's our problem in three words.
