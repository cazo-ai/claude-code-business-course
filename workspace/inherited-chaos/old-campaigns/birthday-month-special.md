# Campaign: Birthday Month Special

## Status
Ongoing (automated)

## Goal
Personal touch, drive visits during birthday month

## Execution
- Free smoothie during birthday month
- Push notification on actual birthday
- Email reminder at start of month
- 50 bonus points when redeemed

## Results
- Redemption rate: 34%
- Members who redeem: already active users
- Inactive members: still don't come in
- Nice touch but not moving engagement needle

## What Worked
- Members who redeem appreciate it
- Easy to automate
- Low cost per redemption

## What Didn't Work
- Doesn't activate inactive members
- Preaching to the choir
- Free smoothie isn't compelling enough for lapsed members
- Feels generic ("every gym does birthday stuff")

## Cost
$180/month (smoothie cost + system maintenance)

## Jessica's Notes
It's fine. Members like it. But it's not solving our engagement problem. The people who use it are already coming regularly. The people we need to reach don't even see the notification because they never open the app.
