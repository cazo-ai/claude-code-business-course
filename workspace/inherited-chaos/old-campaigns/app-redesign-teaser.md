# Campaign: App Redesign Teaser

## Status
Completed - March (never launched actual redesign)

## Goal
Re-engage lapsed users with "something new coming"

## Execution
- Email to inactive members
- "We heard you - big changes coming to FitRewards"
- Survey asking what they want to see
- Teaser video showing UI improvements

## Results
- Email open rate: 11% (low)
- Survey responses: 187
- Excitement level: minimal
- Common feedback: "UI isn't the problem"

## What Worked
- Got some useful survey feedback

## What Didn't Work
- Members don't care about UI updates
- "A prettier app won't make me use it more"
- "Fix the experience, not the interface"
- Created expectations we couldn't meet

## Cost
$2,900 (survey platform + video production + marketing)

## Jessica's Notes
Face-palm moment. We thought a fresh coat of paint would bring people back. Nope. Members were clear: they don't need a redesign, they need a reason to care. The survey responses were brutal but honest. "Make it personal" came up 43 times. That should have been our clue.

## Survey Quotes Worth Noting
> "I don't care what it looks like. Give me something that knows WHO I am."
> "Help me figure out what kind of workouts I should be doing."
> "Planet Fitness knows I'm a cardio person. Why doesn't FitHub?"
