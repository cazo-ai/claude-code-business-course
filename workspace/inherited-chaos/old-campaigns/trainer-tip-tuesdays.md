# Campaign: Trainer Tip Tuesdays

## Status
Completed - Ongoing for 6 weeks, then stopped

## Goal
Give members reason to open app weekly

## Execution
- Weekly push notification with fitness tip
- Featuring different trainers each week
- Bonus: 10 points for watching tip video
- Tips on form, nutrition, recovery, etc.

## Results
- Week 1 open rate: 22%
- Week 6 open rate: 6%
- Video completion rate: 31% initially, 8% by end
- Members disabled notifications or ignored

## What Worked
- Trainers loved being featured
- Content quality was actually good

## What Didn't Work
- Generic tips, not personalized
- Felt like spam after a few weeks
- Points weren't motivating enough
- "Just send me tips for MY workout type"

## Cost
$4,200 (video production + management time)

## Jessica's Notes
Good content, wrong delivery. Members want personalized guidance, not generic tips for everyone. The cardio people didn't care about strength tips. The yoga folks tuned out cardio content. We were shouting into the void.
