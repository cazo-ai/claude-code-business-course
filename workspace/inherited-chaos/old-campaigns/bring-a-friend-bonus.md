# Campaign: Bring a Friend Bonus

## Status
Completed - February

## Goal
Member referrals and social engagement

## Execution
- Members get 100 bonus points for bringing a friend
- Friend gets free 1-week pass
- Email campaign + in-gym promotion
- Ran for 3 weeks

## Results
- 67 friends brought in
- 12 converted to paid memberships (18%)
- Modest success on acquisition
- No impact on referrer engagement

## What Worked
- Clear value prop for both parties
- Simple mechanics
- Some new member acquisition

## What Didn't Work
- Didn't increase referrer's app engagement
- One-time action, no ongoing behavior change
- Members said "I'd bring friends anyway, points don't change that"

## Cost
$1,800 (marketing + free pass value)

## Jessica's Notes
Decent referral campaign but didn't solve the core problem - people aren't engaging with the app regularly. They just brought a friend once and went back to ignoring FitRewards.
