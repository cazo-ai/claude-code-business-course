# Campaign: Double Points Weekend

## Status
Completed - February

## Goal
Increase weekend visit frequency

## Execution
- Email blast to all members
- In-gym signage
- App push notification
- Fri-Sun: earn 2x points per visit

## Results
- Email open rate: 14%
- Weekend visits up 8% (modest)
- Most participants were already regular weekend visitors
- New member acquisition: minimal

## What Worked
- Simple to understand
- Easy to implement

## What Didn't Work
- Didn't attract new users
- Temporary spike, no lasting behavior change
- Members said "points still don't motivate me long-term"

## Cost
$1,200 (email platform + signage)

## Jessica's Notes
Okay campaign. Moved the needle slightly but didn't solve the core engagement problem. Members who already came just got more points. Members who don't care about points... still don't care.
