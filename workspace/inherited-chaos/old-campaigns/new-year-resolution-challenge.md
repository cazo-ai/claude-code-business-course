# Campaign: New Year Resolution Challenge

## Status
Completed - January

## Goal
Capitalize on New Year motivation, drive app engagement

## Execution
- "30 Workouts in 30 Days" challenge
- Track progress in app
- Badge + 500 bonus points for completion
- Email reminders weekly

## Results
- 187 members signed up
- 23 members completed (12% completion rate)
- App engagement temporarily up
- Most dropped off after week 2

## What Worked
- Good initial sign-ups
- Badge was popular with completers
- Clear goal structure

## What Didn't Work
- Too ambitious for most members
- No personalization (same challenge for everyone)
- Felt like homework, not fun
- Completers were already regular gym-goers

## Cost
$2,800 (development + marketing)

## Jessica's Notes
Classic mistake - designed for our most engaged members, not the ones we're trying to activate. The 12% who finished didn't need motivation. The 88% who quit felt like failures. Ugh.
