# Campaign: Social Media Share Challenge

## Status
Completed - March (regrettably)

## Goal
Viral growth through social sharing

## Execution
- Share workout selfie with #FitHubRewards
- Each share = 25 bonus points
- Grand prize: 1 year free membership
- Ran for 2 weeks

## Results
- Total shares: 34 (yes, thirty-four)
- Only 12 unique members participated
- Zero viral spread
- Prize went to member who posted 8 times (awkward)
- Comments: "forced" and "cringy"

## What Worked
- Honestly? Nothing.

## What Didn't Work
- Members don't want to broadcast their gym activity
- Felt inauthentic and performative
- Prize wasn't motivating enough
- Nobody wants their social feed to be gym ads

## Cost
$3,200 (development + prize value + marketing)

## Jessica's Notes
My biggest failure. Assumed people would want to share like they do with coffee or food. Turns out gym experiences are personal, not public for most people. Learned a valuable lesson about authenticity. This one still stings.
