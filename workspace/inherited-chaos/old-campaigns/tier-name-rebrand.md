# Campaign: Tier Name Rebrand

## Status
Completed - January

## Goal
Make tiers more aspirational and engaging

## Execution
- Changed tier names:
  - Bronze → "Starter"
  - Silver → "Achiever"
  - Gold → "Elite"
- Updated app UI
- Email announcement
- In-gym signage

## Results
- Member response: complete indifference
- Engagement metrics: unchanged
- Comments: "Names don't matter, benefits do"
- Waste of time and resources

## What Worked
- New UI looks slightly better

## What Didn't Work
- Members literally don't care about tier names
- No behavior change whatsoever
- Cosmetic fix to structural problem
- Should have spent resources elsewhere

## Cost
$2,400 (design + development + marketing)

## Jessica's Notes
Huge lesson learned: lipstick on a pig. The problem isn't what we CALL the tiers, it's that the tiers themselves don't matter to members. They don't care if they're "Bronze" or "Starter" - they care about whether the program actually adds value to their fitness journey. This was my "oh crap, we're focusing on the wrong things" moment.
