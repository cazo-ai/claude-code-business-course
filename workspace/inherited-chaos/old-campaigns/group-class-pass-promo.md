# Campaign: Group Class Pass Promotion

## Status
Completed - March

## Goal
Increase group class attendance, cross-sell to cardio-only members

## Execution
- Gold tier members: 1 free group class pass
- Silver tier: 50% off group class
- Email + app notification
- Featured classes: Yoga, Spin, HIIT, Pilates

## Results
- Redemption: 18% (low)
- New class attendees: 41 members
- Retention of new class-goers: 12% (most went back to solo workouts)
- Feedback: "Not interested in classes" or "Don't know which class is right for me"

## What Worked
- Members who redeemed enjoyed the classes
- Some discovered new workout styles

## What Didn't Work
- Most members ignored it
- No guidance on which class to try
- Felt like a random discount, not personalized
- "How do I know if I'm a spin person or a yoga person?"

## Cost
$1,600 (promo cost + marketing)

## Jessica's Notes
We assumed members would just try classes if we made them cheaper. Wrong. They don't know which class matches their interests or fitness level. They need guidance, not discounts. Again - we're solving the wrong problem.
