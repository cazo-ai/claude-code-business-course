# Campaign: Personal Training Discount

## Status
Completed - April

## Goal
Upsell personal training, demonstrate program value

## Execution
- Silver+ members: 20% off first PT session
- Email campaign highlighting trainer bios
- App banner promotion
- "Find your perfect trainer" messaging

## Results
- Redemption: 9% (very low)
- Sessions booked: 23
- Conversions to ongoing PT: 4 members
- Feedback: "Too expensive even with discount" and "Don't know which trainer to pick"

## What Worked
- The 4 who converted are happy
- PT sessions themselves were well-received

## What Didn't Work
- Price still too high for most
- Trainer bios didn't help with selection
- Generic messaging, no personalization
- "Which trainer matches my workout style?"

## Cost
$1,100 (discount cost + marketing)

## Jessica's Notes
Another swing and a miss. We're offering discounts when members want guidance. They don't know how to pick a trainer. They don't know what training style fits them. We keep throwing promotions at problems that require personalization.
