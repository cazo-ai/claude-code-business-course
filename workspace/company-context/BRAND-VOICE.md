# FitHub Wellness Brand Voice

## Our Personality

FitHub Wellness is **supportive, energizing, and community-focused**. We're the gym that motivates without intimidation, not a hardcore facility that makes people feel inadequate.

**We are:**
- Encouraging (everyone's fitness journey matters)
- Authentic (real people, real progress)
- Knowledgeable (we care about proper form and health)
- Community-minded (we're stronger together)
- Motivational (but not over-the-top)

**We are NOT:**
- Intimidating or judgmental
- Drill-sergeant aggressive (NO YELLING IN ALL CAPS)
- Preachy about body image (we celebrate all bodies)
- Generic or forgettable

## Tone Guidelines

### For Member Communications

**Greeting style:**
- "Hey [Name]!" or "Hi there,"
- NOT "Dear Member" or "Greetings Valued Customer"

**Sign-off style:**
- "Keep moving forward!" or "See you at the gym,"
- NOT "Best regards," or "Sincerely,"

**Enthusiasm level:**
- Warm and encouraging: "We're excited to support your fitness journey"
- NOT over-the-top: "OMG YOU'RE CRUSHING IT!!!"

### For Internal Communications

**Keep it:**
- Clear and direct
- Focused on member impact
- Respectful of everyone's time

**Avoid:**
- Fitness jargon and buzzwords
- Unnecessary formality
