# Your Situation

## The Company: FitHub Wellness

FitHub Wellness is a regional fitness chain with **35 locations** across the Southwest (Phoenix, Tucson, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, and surrounding areas). Founded in 2016, the company has built a strong reputation by focusing on:

- Supportive, non-intimidating workout environment
- Community-driven group classes and events
- Affordable memberships with no hidden fees
- A welcoming vibe (think: the gym that motivates, doesn't intimidate)

The company is profitable but member retention has plateaued. Leadership is looking for ways to increase visit frequency and build stronger member relationships.

## The Loyalty Program

Six months ago, leadership launched **FitRewards** - a points-based app to track visits and reward member activity. The hope was to:

1. Increase visit frequency (from 2x/week to 4x/week for active members)
2. Capture member data for personalized fitness recommendations
3. Compete with Planet Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness loyalty features
4. Turn casual members into committed community participants

**The problem:** The program isn't working as expected.

## Your Role

You're the **new Member Experience Manager** at FitHub Wellness. You were hired to bring fresh energy to the company and tackle member engagement challenges. You've got a lot on your plate - operations, staff training, member satisfaction - but one urgent priority keeps coming up: the failing rewards program.

The previous manager left things in a mess. Among the chaos you inherited:
- A folder full of messy notes, half-finished promotion ideas, and scattered data
- A rewards app with decent sign-up numbers but terrible engagement
- Leadership who's skeptical ("We've invested $40K in this - where are the results?")
- A deadline: **3 months to turn the rewards program around, or leadership is considering shutting it down**

## The Stakes

If the program fails:
- $40K investment wasted
- Member data goes unused
- Competitive disadvantage vs. Planet Fitness/24 Hour Fitness
- Your reputation takes a hit (you didn't create the problem, but you own it now)

If you can turn it around:
- Prove yourself as someone who can solve tough challenges
- Build something that actually helps members and the business
- Potentially expand your role to other regions

## Your Goal

Over the next few hours, you're going to use Claude Code to:

1. **Make sense of the chaos** - Analyze what you inherited
2. **Understand the problems** - What's actually going wrong?
3. **Find solutions** - What do successful programs do differently?
4. **Build something** - Create a prototype that could save the program

By the end, you'll have real skills AND a real deliverable.

Let's get started.
