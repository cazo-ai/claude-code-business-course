# FitRewards Program Details

## Program Overview

**Launch Date:** 6 months ago
**Investment:** $40,000
**Current Status:** Struggling

## How It Works

### Points System
- 1 point per gym visit
- 5 bonus points for attending group classes
- 2 bonus points for referring a friend
- Points never expire

### Reward Tiers

**Bronze (0-100 points)**
- Free gym t-shirt on sign-up
- Birthday month: 1 free smoothie

**Silver (101-300 points)**
- 10% off personal training sessions
- Priority class registration
- Free guest pass (1 per month)

**Gold (301+ points)**
- 15% off all services
- Free fitness assessment quarterly
- VIP locker access

## Current Metrics

- **Total sign-ups:** 11,800 members
- **Active users (monthly):** 1,950 members (~16.5% engagement)
- **App opens per user:** Declining from 5.1 to 1.2 per month
- **Average visits per member:** Down from 4.2 to 1.4 per month

## The Problem

Members sign up when onboarded but rarely engage with the app afterward. The program feels transactional rather than motivational.

## Budget Constraints

- **Total annual budget:** $75,000
- **Already spent:** $40,000 (app development, marketing)
- **Remaining for improvements:** $35,000
- **Monthly operational cost:** $2,800

## What's Been Tried

1. **Push notifications** - Ignored or disabled by users
2. **Double points weekends** - Minimal engagement boost
3. **Social sharing features** - Almost no one uses them
4. **Tier name changes** - Made no difference

## Leadership Expectations

- Increase engagement to 35-40% within 3 months
- Demonstrate clear ROI on the investment
- Create something members actually want to use
- Differentiate from competitor programs
