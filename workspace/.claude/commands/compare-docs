# Skill: Document Comparison

## What This Does
Performs side-by-side comparison of two or more documents, highlighting differences, changes, and discrepancies.

## When to Use
- Comparing contract versions
- Reviewing proposal changes
- Analyzing before/after edits
- Spotting differences in similar documents
- Tracking document evolution
- Validating accuracy across versions

## How It Works
Reads multiple documents and creates a structured comparison showing:
- **What changed** - Additions, deletions, modifications
- **What stayed the same** - Common elements
- **Significance** - Which changes matter most
- **Discrepancies** - Conflicting information
- **Recommendations** - Actions based on differences

## Instructions

When comparing documents, provide analysis in this format:

```markdown
# Document Comparison

**Documents Compared:**
1. [Document 1 name/path]
2. [Document 2 name/path]

**Comparison Date:** [Today]

---

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences: Biggest difference + significance]

**Overall Assessment:** [Similar / Significantly Different / Completely Different]

---

## Key Differences

### 1. [Category or Section]

**Document 1:**
> [Quote or summary of content]

**Document 2:**
> [Quote or summary of content]

**Significance:** [Why this matters]
**Recommendation:** [Action to take, if any]

### 2. [Category or Section]
[Repeat format]

[Continue for all major differences]

---

## Additions

**In Document 2 but not Document 1:**
- [Item] - [Location]
- [Item] - [Location]

**Significance:** [What these additions mean]

---

## Deletions

**In Document 1 but not Document 2:**
- [Item] - [Location]
- [Item] - [Location]

**Significance:** [Impact of these deletions]

---

## Unchanged Elements
[List what remained the same - helps establish baseline]

---

## Discrepancies & Conflicts
[If documents claim different facts or contradict each other]

| Topic | Document 1 | Document 2 | Resolution Needed? |
|-------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| [Topic] | [Version 1] | [Version 2] | [Yes/No + why] |

---

## Detailed Change Log
[Section-by-section breakdown if documents are structured similarly]

### [Section Name]
- **Changed:** [What changed]
- **From:** [Original]
- **To:** [New version]

---

## Recommendations

**Critical Actions:**
1. [Action based on significant difference]

**Review Needed:**
- [Item requiring human review/decision]

**No Action Needed:**
- [Differences that don't require response]

---

## Summary Statistics
- **Sections compared:** X
- **Identical sections:** Y
- **Modified sections:** Z
- **Major changes:** N
- **Minor changes:** M
```

### Comparison Types:

**Version Comparison:**
Track how a document evolved over time

**Alternative Comparison:**
Compare two different approaches to same problem

**Accuracy Check:**
Validate one document against authoritative source

**Consolidation:**
Identify what to keep from each version

## Usage Examples

**Basic Comparison:**
```
compare-docs @proposal-v1.md @proposal-v2.md
```

**Contract Review:**
```
compare-docs @contract-draft.pdf @contract-final.pdf

Focus on: Terms, pricing, deliverables, dates
```

**Multi-Document:**
```
compare-docs @version1.md @version2.md @version3.md

Show evolution across all three versions
```

**With Specific Focus:**
```
compare-docs @old-plan.md @new-plan.md

Only compare: Budget, timeline, and deliverables
Ignore: Formatting and minor wording changes
```

**Validation:**
```
compare-docs @our-data.csv @official-source.csv

Flag any discrepancies in: Revenue numbers and dates
```

## Comparison Levels

**High-Level (Default):**
- Major structural differences
- Significant content changes
- Critical discrepancies

**Detailed:**
- Line-by-line comparison
- All wording changes
- Formatting differences

**Critical-Only:**
- Just the most important changes
- Business-impacting differences only

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Specify what matters** - Tell me which sections/elements are most important
2. **Note document type** - Contract vs. proposal vs. data requires different focus
3. **Mention context** - Why you're comparing helps me prioritize relevance
4. **Request depth level** - Quick overview vs. thorough comparison
5. **Identify deal-breakers** - Any changes that would be unacceptable

## Common Use Cases

### Contract Negotiation
Compare versions to track what changed in negotiations

### Quality Assurance
Ensure final version matches approved draft

### Competitive Analysis
Compare your proposal vs. competitor's (if available)

### Version Control
Understand what changed between revisions

### Data Validation
Check consistency across data sources

## Output
A clear, structured comparison that helps you understand exactly what changed and why it matters, saving hours of manual review.
