### Executive Summary Principles:

1. **Lead with the conclusion** - Don't make them read to find out what you recommend
2. **Quantify everything** - Use numbers, not adjectives
3. **One page ideal** - Two pages maximum
4. **Assume no context** - They're seeing this for first time
5. **Be clear about the ask** - What decision/resource do you need?
6. **Show you've thought it through** - Address obvious risks

### Tone Guidelines:

- **Confident, not arrogant** - "We recommend" not "We should obviously"
- **Data-driven** - Lead with facts, not opinions
- **Action-oriented** - Focus on decisions, not just information
- **Respectful of time** - Every sentence earns its place
- **Clear about unknowns** - Don't hide uncertainty

## Usage Examples

**From Long Report:**
```
executive-summary @detailed-analysis.md

Audience: VP of Product
Focus on: ROI and timeline
```

**From Multiple Sources:**
```
executive-summary

Based on:
- @customer-research.md
- @competitive-analysis.md
- @financial-model.csv

Create 1-page summary for CEO about whether to enter new market
```

**From Project Update:**
```
executive-summary

Project: Q4 Platform Redesign
Current status: 3 weeks behind schedule
Need: Additional budget approval
Audience: CFO
```

**Quick Brief:**
```
executive-summary --brief

[Describe situation in a few sentences]

Create ultra-concise version (1/2 page max)
```

## Output Variations

**Standard (Default):**
Full format as shown above (1-2 pages)

**Brief:**
Situation + Recommendation + Ask only (1/2 page)

**Decision Memo:**
Focus on options and recommendation

**Status Update:**
Current state + issues + needs

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Know your audience** - C-suite vs. Director vs. Board have different needs
2. **Lead with impact** - Start with business outcomes, not technical details
3. **Quantify everything** - "20% increase" not "significant improvement"
4. **Be specific about asks** - "Approve $50K" not "Provide resources"
5. **Show you've thought ahead** - Address obvious questions preemptively

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too much detail** - Save that for appendix
❌ **Burying the ask** - Put it upfront AND at the end
❌ **No numbers** - Quantify impact and requirements
❌ **Vague recommendations** - Be specific and actionable
❌ **Ignoring risks** - Address concerns proactively

## Output
A polished, professional executive summary that respects leadership's time while giving them everything needed to make an informed decision.
