# Skill: Decision Matrix

## What This Does
Creates structured decision analysis frameworks to help you make data-driven choices between multiple options.

## When to Use
- Choosing between 2+ alternatives
- Need objective evaluation framework
- Stakeholders disagree on direction
- High-stakes decisions requiring documentation
- When gut feeling isn't enough
- Want to defend your choice with data

## How It Works
Analyzes your options against weighted criteria and creates:
- **Structured comparison** - Apples-to-apples evaluation
- **Scoring framework** - Objective ranking
- **Pros/cons analysis** - Clear trade-offs
- **Recommendation** - Data-backed choice
- **Risk assessment** - What could go wrong

## Instructions

When helping with a decision, create this comprehensive analysis:

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Define criteria first** - What really matters for this decision?
2. **Weight honestly** - Don't make everything equal importance
3. **Be objective** - Score based on data, not preference
4. **Consider context** - Budget, timeline, constraints matter
5. **Document assumptions** - What you believe to be true
6. **Plan for wrong** - How you'll know if you need to pivot

## Output
A comprehensive decision framework that removes emotion, provides structure, and gives you confidence (and documentation) for your choice.
