# Skill: Email Draft from Notes

## What This Does
Creates professional, well-structured emails from bullet points, rough notes, or verbal descriptions.

## When to Use
- Need to send an important email but don't want to spend 30 minutes writing it
- Have key points but struggle with professional tone
- Want to ensure proper email structure
- Need to communicate clearly with stakeholders

## How It Works
Takes your rough thoughts or bullet points and creates a polished, professional email with:
- **Clear subject line**
- **Appropriate greeting**
- **Well-structured body**
- **Professional tone**
- **Clear call-to-action**
- **Proper sign-off**

## Instructions

Based on the provided notes or context, draft a professional email following these guidelines:

### Structure:
```markdown
**Subject:** [Clear, specific subject line - no "Update" or "Quick question"]

[Greeting appropriate to relationship with recipient]

[Opening paragraph - Context/purpose in 1-2 sentences]

[Main content - organized by topic/priority]

[Closing paragraph - Clear next steps or call-to-action]

[Professional sign-off]
```

### Tone Guidelines:
- **Professional but warm** - Not stiff or overly formal
- **Clear and concise** - Respect recipient's time
- **Action-oriented** - Make next steps obvious
- **Confident but not presumptuous**

### Key Principles:
1. **Front-load importance** - Most critical info in first paragraph
2. **Use formatting** - Bullets, bold, sections for scannability
3. **One ask per email** - Don't bury multiple requests
4. **Be specific** - "Let's meet Tuesday 2pm" not "Let's meet sometime"
5. **End with clarity** - Recipient knows exactly what to do next

### Adapt Tone Based On:
- **Relationship:** Colleague vs. executive vs. client vs. vendor
- **Context:** Good news vs. bad news vs. request vs. update
- **Urgency:** Time-sensitive vs. FYI
- **Formality:** Startup culture vs. corporate environment

## Usage Example

**Option 1 - From File:**
```
email-draft @update-notes.md

Context: Sending to my manager about project delay
Tone: Professional but honest
```

**Option 2 - From Description:**
```
email-draft

I need to email the client about:
- Project is 2 weeks behind schedule
- Due to unexpected technical issues
- We have a plan to get back on track
- Need their approval for revised timeline

Tone: Apologetic but confident in solution
```

**Option 3 - Quick Email:**
```
email-draft to Sarah about pushing Friday's meeting to Monday because I need more time to prepare the slides
```

## Output
A complete, ready-to-send email that you can copy-paste or adjust as needed. The email will match the context and tone you specified.

## Tips
- **Be specific about recipient and context** - Helps me match the right tone
- **Mention any sensitive topics** - I'll handle them appropriately
- **Specify length preference** - Short update vs. detailed explanation
- **Note any required elements** - Attachments, CC list, specific asks
