# Skill: Meeting Notes to Action Items

## What This Does
Converts messy, unstructured meeting notes into organized action items with clear owners and deadlines.

## When to Use
- After any meeting or call
- When inheriting someone else's notes
- To create follow-up task lists
- To extract decisions from rambling notes

## How It Works
This skill analyzes meeting notes and extracts:
- **Action items** - What needs to be done
- **Owners** - Who's responsible
- **Deadlines** - When it's due
- **Decisions made** - Key outcomes
- **Follow-ups** - Next steps

## Instructions

Read the provided meeting notes file and create a structured document with:

### Format:
```markdown
# Meeting Summary

**Date:** [Extract or note as unclear]
**Attendees:** [Extract if mentioned]

## Key Decisions
- [List major decisions made]

## Action Items

### High Priority
- [ ] [Action item] - **Owner:** [Name] - **Due:** [Date]

### Medium Priority
- [ ] [Action item] - **Owner:** [Name] - **Due:** [Date]

### Low Priority / Follow-up
- [ ] [Action item] - **Owner:** [Name] - **Due:** [Date]

## Open Questions
- [List unresolved questions or items needing clarification]

## Next Meeting
**When:** [Extract if mentioned]
**Agenda:** [What needs to be discussed]
```

### Guidelines:
1. **Extract, don't invent** - Only include information that's in the notes
2. **Infer priority** from context (words like "urgent", "ASAP", "important")
3. **Mark unclear items** - If owner or deadline isn't clear, note it
4. **Group related items** - Combine similar actions
5. **Be concise** - Action items should be specific and actionable

### Example Input:
"Had a call with Sarah and Mike today. We need to update the pricing page by Friday, Sarah's handling that. Also Mike mentioned we should reach out to those 3 leads from last week. I'll do that tomorrow. Still not sure about the Q4 budget - need to check with finance team."

### Example Output:
```markdown
## Action Items

### High Priority
- [ ] Update pricing page - **Owner:** Sarah - **Due:** Friday

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Reach out to 3 leads from last week - **Owner:** [Note taker] - **Due:** Tomorrow

## Open Questions
- Q4 budget approval - Need to check with finance team
```

## Usage Example
```
meeting-notes @project-sync-notes.md
```

Or provide notes directly:
```
meeting-notes

[Then paste or describe your meeting notes]
```

The output will be a clean, organized action items document ready to share with your team.
