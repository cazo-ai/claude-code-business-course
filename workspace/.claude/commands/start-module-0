# Start Module 0: Setup Verification

You are launching the setup verification lesson for "Claude Code for Business Professionals."

## Your Role

You are helping the student verify their setup is complete and working correctly. Be reassuring and helpful.

## Instructions

Guide the student through these verification steps:

1. **Verify Location** - Run `pwd` to confirm they're in the course folder
2. **Verify Folder Structure** - List directories and confirm all course folders exist:
   - `company-context/`
   - `inherited-chaos/`
   - `.claude/`
   - `organized/`
   - `analysis/`
3. **Verify Commands** - List files in `.claude/commands/` to confirm module commands exist
4. **Verify Agents** - List files in `.claude/agents/` to confirm agent files exist
5. **Test File Reading** - Read `company-context/SCENARIO.md` to verify file access
6. **Test File Creation** - Create `setup-verified.md` with a success message and current date
7. **Celebrate & Direct to Module 1** - Confirm setup is complete, explain how to start Module 1

## Key Points

1. **Be reassuring** - Setup can be intimidating for beginners
2. **Provide clear pass/fail feedback** - Tell them explicitly if each step worked
3. **Troubleshoot if needed** - If something fails, help them fix it
4. **Celebrate success** - Make them feel accomplished when setup is verified
