# Skill: Deep Folder Analysis

## What This Does
Provides comprehensive analysis of any folder's contents - understanding themes, finding patterns, identifying key information across multiple files.

## When to Use
- Inheriting a project or folder from someone else
- Need to understand a complex folder structure quickly
- Looking for patterns across many documents
- Creating executive summary of project status
- Onboarding to new work area

## How It Works
Reads all files in a folder (or recursively through subfolders) and provides:
- **Content overview** - What types of information exist
- **Key themes** - Patterns across documents
- **Important findings** - Critical information surfaced
- **Data quality** - Gaps, inconsistencies, or issues
- **Recommendations** - Suggested actions or next steps

## Instructions

When a user provides a folder path, perform this analysis:

### Step 1: Inventory
- List all files and subfolders
- Identify file types and purposes
- Note file dates/recency where relevant

### Step 2: Content Analysis
Read and analyze files to identify:
- **Main themes** - What topics/issues appear repeatedly
- **Key data points** - Metrics, dates, names, decisions
- **Document purposes** - Strategy docs vs. data vs. notes vs. drafts
- **Relationships** - How files connect to each other

### Step 3: Synthesis
Create a structured summary:

```markdown
# Folder Analysis: [Folder Name]

## Overview
- **File count:** X files in Y folders
- **Date range:** [Oldest to newest]
- **Primary content type:** [Documents/Data/Mixed]

## Key Findings

### 1. [Most Important Finding]
- Evidence: [Which files]
- Significance: [Why it matters]

### 2. [Second Finding]
- Evidence: [Which files]
- Significance: [Why it matters]

[Continue for 3-5 key findings]

## Themes Across Files
- **[Theme 1]:** Appears in [X] files - [Description]
- **[Theme 2]:** Appears in [X] files - [Description]

## Critical Information
- **Decisions made:** [List]
- **Open questions:** [List]
- **Action items:** [List]
- **Key metrics:** [List]

## Data Quality Assessment
- **Complete:** [What's well-documented]
- **Gaps:** [What's missing]
- **Inconsistencies:** [Conflicts between files]

## Recommendations
1. [Immediate action needed]
2. [Follow-up investigation suggested]
3. [Organization improvements]
```

### Analysis Depth Levels:

**Quick Scan (Default):**
- Read all files
- Identify main themes
- Surface critical information

**Deep Dive (if user requests):**
- Detailed analysis of each file
- Cross-reference information
- Timeline reconstruction
- Stakeholder mapping

**Executive Summary (if user requests):**
- 1-page overview only
- Top 3 findings
- Recommended next steps

## Usage Examples

**Basic Analysis:**
```
analyze-folder @project-files/
```

**Deep Analysis:**
```
analyze-folder @inherited-chaos/ --depth deep
```

**With Specific Focus:**
```
analyze-folder @customer-data/

Focus on: What are customers saying about pricing?
```

**Executive Summary:**
```
analyze-folder @q3-reports/ --format executive
```

## Tips for Best Results
- **Specify what you're looking for** if you have specific questions
- **Mention context** if relevant (e.g., "I just inherited this project")
- **Request depth** - Quick overview vs. thorough analysis
- **Note time constraints** - "I have 5 minutes" vs. "I need comprehensive understanding"

## Output
A structured analysis document that gives you situational awareness of the folder's contents without having to read every file manually.
