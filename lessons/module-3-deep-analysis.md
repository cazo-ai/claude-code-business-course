# Module 3: Deep Analysis & Synthesis - Interactive Lesson

Welcome to Module 3! You've learned to explore files and extract information. Now we're going to analyze like a strategist.

This interactive lesson will take about 30-35 minutes.

STOP: Have you watched the Module 3 video?

USER: Yes / Ready

## From Information to Insight

In Module 2, you learned to gather information. That's important, but it's not enough.

Your job isn't just to report what you find. It's to:
- Identify root causes
- Connect disparate information
- Generate strategic recommendations
- Make data-driven decisions

That's what analysis is about.

STOP: Ready to think strategically?

USER: Yes / Ready

## The Core Question

Let's start with the most important question about FitRewards:

**Why is engagement so low?**

You have:
- 11,800 total members
- Only 1,950 active monthly users
- 16.5% engagement (target is 35-40%)

That's not just "a little low." That's a failing program.

STOP: Based on what you've seen so far, what do you think is the main problem?

USER: Their hypothesis

[Acknowledge their response]

Good thinking. But let's not rely on hunches. Let's find evidence.

---

## Task 1: Root Cause Analysis

**Ask me: "Analyze all customer feedback, campaign performance, and the previous manager's notes. What are the root causes of low engagement?"**

This is a complex request spanning multiple sources. Let me work through it systematically.

STOP: Go ahead and ask.

USER: Asks for root cause analysis

ACTION: Read and analyze:
- All customer feedback files
- Previous manager notes
- Campaign files with performance indicators
- Loyalty program structure

Then synthesize findings into clear root causes with supporting evidence

Based on my analysis, I've identified three major root causes:

1. **[Root Cause 1]** - [Evidence from specific files]
2. **[Root Cause 2]** - [Evidence from specific files]
3. **[Root Cause 3]** - [Evidence from specific files]

Notice how each cause is backed by evidence from your files? That's data-driven analysis.

STOP: Does this align with your hypothesis?

USER: Response

---

## Task 2: Connect the Dots

Now let's do something powerful: connect information from different sources.

**Ask me: "How do member complaints relate to the campaigns that were run? Are there any clear patterns?"**

STOP: Your turn.

USER: Asks about connections

ACTION: Cross-reference customer feedback files with campaign files, identifying temporal patterns and cause-effect relationships

Here's what I found:

[Present specific examples like:]
- The "Tier Name Rebrand" campaign in January caused confusion mentioned in February feedback
- "Double Points Weekend" had technical issues documented in both the campaign file and March feedback
- Member complaints about app complexity increased after the "App Redesign Teaser"

This is synthesis - combining multiple sources to reveal hidden patterns.

STOP: See how these connect?

USER: Confirms

---

## Task 3: Competitive Positioning Analysis

You've looked at competitor research. Now let's analyze it strategically.

**Ask me: "Based on competitor research, what are FitHub's competitive advantages and disadvantages in their rewards program?"**

STOP: Go ahead.

USER: Asks for competitive analysis

ACTION: Read all competitor research files and compare to FitHub's LOYALTY-PROGRAM.md, creating a structured competitive analysis

Here's the competitive landscape:

**FitHub's Advantages:**
- [Advantage 1 with evidence]
- [Advantage 2 with evidence]

**FitHub's Disadvantages:**
- [Disadvantage 1 with evidence]
- [Disadvantage 2 with evidence]

**Key Insight:** [Strategic observation about positioning]

STOP: What surprises you about this analysis?

USER: Response

---

## Task 4: Identify What Worked

Not everything failed. Some campaigns had better results than others.

**Ask me: "Which campaigns showed the most promise based on the notes? What made them more successful?"**

STOP: Your turn.

USER: Asks about successful campaigns

ACTION: Analyze campaign files looking for success indicators, member response, and engagement metrics mentioned in notes

Based on the campaign files, here's what worked:

**Most Promising Campaigns:**
1. [Campaign name] - [Why it worked]
2. [Campaign name] - [Why it worked]

**Common Success Factors:**
- [Factor 1]
- [Factor 2]
- [Factor 3]

This tells you what to replicate and what to avoid.

STOP: Should we save this analysis?

USER: Response

[If yes:]
ACTION: Create analysis/what-worked-analysis.md with full findings

Saved!

---

## Task 5: Create a Strategic Recommendation

Now we're going to synthesize everything into a strategic recommendation.

This is the most advanced task yet. You'll ask me to pull from:
- Root cause analysis
- Competitive positioning
- What worked and didn't work
- Member feedback patterns
- FitHub's brand and constraints

**Ask me: "Create a strategic recommendation document for turning around FitRewards. Include the problem statement, root causes, strategic approach, and 3-5 specific recommendations. Save it as analysis/strategic-recommendations.md"**

STOP: Take your time crafting this request. Then ask me.

USER: Asks for strategic recommendations

ACTION: Create comprehensive analysis/strategic-recommendations.md including:
- Executive Summary
- Problem Statement with metrics
- Root Cause Analysis (from earlier work)
- Strategic Approach
- Specific Recommendations (3-5 actionable items with rationale)
- Success Metrics
- Implementation Timeline

Done! This is an executive-ready strategic document.

ACTION: Read strategic-recommendations.md back to them

STOP: Does this feel like something you could present to leadership?

USER: Response

[If they want changes, make them]

## Deep Dive Practice

Now practice deep analysis on your own. Choose one of these challenges:

**Option 1: Brand Voice Alignment**
"Analyze FitHub's brand voice guidelines against the old campaigns. Which campaigns were off-brand and why? Create a brand alignment report."

**Option 2: Member Segmentation**
"Based on customer feedback, identify different member segments and their unique pain points. Recommend personalized approaches for each segment."

**Option 3: Timeline Analysis**
"Create a timeline of events from January to April showing campaigns, member feedback, and engagement trends. Identify critical moments."

**Pick one and ask me to help you create a comprehensive analysis document.**

STOP: Choose your challenge and dive in. Let me know when you're done.

USER: Chooses option and works through analysis

[Help them complete their chosen analysis, creating a professional document]

[When done, continue:]

## The Synthesis Challenge

Final challenge. This one's tough but rewarding.

**Ask me: "If you had to present FitRewards' situation to the executive team in 5 minutes, what would you say? Create a 5-minute presentation outline with key points and supporting data."**

STOP: Ready for this?

USER: Confirms and asks

ACTION: Create organized/exec-presentation-outline.md with:
- Opening hook
- Problem statement with key metrics
- Root causes (3 max)
- Strategic solution
- Specific asks from leadership
- Timeline
- Each section with supporting data points and talking points

Done! Let me show you.

ACTION: Read the presentation outline

This is synthesis at its best - distilling hours of analysis into 5 compelling minutes.

STOP: Feel ready to present this?

USER: Response

## Reflection: Analysis vs. Summarization

Let's pause and talk about what you just did.

There's a difference between:
- **Summarization**: "Here's what the files say"
- **Analysis**: "Here's what the files mean"

You did analysis. You:
- Found root causes, not just symptoms
- Connected disparate information sources
- Identified what matters vs. what's noise
- Generated strategic recommendations
- Created executive-ready deliverables

STOP: How does this change how you think about working with information?

USER: Response

[Acknowledge response]

This is the power of Claude Code. You're not just reading files - you're thinking strategically with an AI partner.
