# Module 2: File Exploration - Interactive Lesson

Welcome back! You've completed Module 1 and learned the basics. Now we're going to level up your file exploration skills.

This interactive lesson will take about 25-30 minutes.

STOP: Have you watched the Module 2 video?

USER: Yes / Ready

## Quick Recap

Last time, you learned to ask me to read individual files. That's great for one file at a time.

But what if you need to:
- Scan 10 files at once?
- Find specific information across multiple documents?
- Compare data from different sources?

That's what we're doing today.

STOP: Ready to explore like a pro?

USER: Yes / Ready

## The Challenge

Let's get real. You've inherited a mess from Jessica, the previous manager.

There are customer feedback files, old campaign notes, competitor research... it's all scattered.

Your first task as Member Experience Manager: **Get organized. Understand what you have.**

ACTION: List all the files in the inherited-chaos folder with descriptions

See all those files? Let's tackle them systematically.

STOP: Which category should we start with: customer feedback, old campaigns, or competitor research?

USER: Chooses one

---

## Task 1: Read Multiple Files at Once

[Regardless of choice]

Great choice! Let's start with customer feedback.

There are four months of feedback files: January through April.

**Ask me: "Read all customer feedback files and summarize the main themes."**

STOP: Go ahead.

USER: Asks to read and summarize

ACTION: Read all four customer feedback files (january.md through april.md) and provide a structured summary of key themes, patterns, and notable quotes

Here's what I found across all four months:
[Present organized themes like: app issues, rewards confusion, trainer communication, etc.]

Notice how I read all four files at once and found patterns? That's the power of asking me to work across multiple files.

STOP: See any patterns that concern you?

USER: Response

---

## Task 2: Search for Specific Information

Good observation. Now let's find something specific.

The previous manager mentioned something about "double points" in one of these files. Let's find it.

**Ask me: "Find all mentions of double points across all files."**

STOP: Your turn.

USER: Asks about double points

ACTION: Search across all files in inherited-chaos for "double points" references and report findings with file names and context

Found it! There's a double points campaign file in old-campaigns.

Let me read that specific file for you.

ACTION: Read inherited-chaos/old-campaigns/double-points-weekend.md

Interesting. A weekend promotion that ran in February. Let's bookmark this for later analysis.

STOP: Want to see what other campaigns were run?

USER: Response

---

## Task 3: Create a Structured Summary

Now let's practice creating organized outputs.

Here's what I want: **Ask me to create a file called "campaign-inventory.md" that lists all the old campaigns with brief descriptions.**

This will help you see everything at a glance.

STOP: Go ahead and ask.

USER: Asks to create the inventory

ACTION: Read all files in inherited-chaos/old-campaigns/, then create organized/campaign-inventory.md with a structured list of campaigns, dates, and brief descriptions

Done! Let me show you what we created.

ACTION: Read the newly created campaign-inventory.md file

This is now your quick reference guide for all past campaigns.

STOP: Helpful, right?

USER: Confirms

---

## Task 4: Compare and Contrast

Let's do something more advanced. We have competitor research on five different gyms.

**Ask me: "Compare the rewards programs of Planet Fitness, LA Fitness, and Orangetheory. What do they do differently than FitHub?"**

STOP: Give it a try.

USER: Asks for comparison

ACTION: Read the three competitor research files and create a comparison analysis highlighting key differences and potential learnings

Here's the comparison:
[Present structured comparison with bullet points for each competitor and key takeaways]

This is powerful. You just had me analyze three dense documents and extract strategic insights in seconds.

STOP: Notice anything FitHub should copy?

USER: Response

---

## Task 5: Find Hidden Insights

Let's dig deeper. Sometimes the most important information is buried in multiple files.

**Ask me: "What are the top 3 complaints members have about the app based on all the feedback files?"**

STOP: Your turn.

USER: Asks about top complaints

ACTION: Analyze all customer feedback files, count and categorize complaint types, and rank the top 3 with supporting quotes

Based on my analysis of all feedback:

1. [Complaint 1 with frequency and quotes]
2. [Complaint 2 with frequency and quotes]
3. [Complaint 3 with frequency and quotes]

Now you have data-driven insights instead of guesses.

STOP: Should we save this analysis?

USER: Yes or response

[If yes:]
ACTION: Create analysis/top-member-complaints.md with the full analysis

Saved to your analysis folder!

---

## Practice: Advanced Exploration

Now it's your turn to practice. Spend 10 minutes exploring and analyzing.

Here are some prompts to try:

- "What's FitHub's brand voice according to the company-context files?"
- "Find all mentions of 'points' or 'rewards' in the old campaigns"
- "Compare January feedback to April feedback - did anything improve?"
- "What does the loyalty program structure look like?"
- "Are there any campaigns that mention member retention?"

**Try at least 3 different exploration tasks. Ask me to save anything useful to your organized or analysis folders.**

STOP: Go explore! Tell me when you're done or if you need help.

USER: Asks various questions, explores, then indicates they're done

[Answer questions naturally as they come, helping create organized outputs as requested]

[When done exploring, continue:]

## Creating Your First Summary Report

Excellent exploration! Now let's put it all together.

I want you to create your first executive summary.

**Ask me: "Create a summary report of the FitHub Wellness situation including current metrics, main member complaints, past campaign summary, and competitive landscape. Save it as analysis/situation-summary.md"**

STOP: Give it a try. Use your own words.

USER: Asks for summary report

ACTION: Create comprehensive analysis/situation-summary.md pulling from multiple sources:
- SCENARIO.md for metrics
- Customer feedback for complaints
- Campaign files for past efforts
- Competitor research for context

Done! This is a professional summary you could share with leadership.

ACTION: Read the situation-summary.md file back to them

STOP: Does this capture everything important?

USER: Confirms or asks for additions

[If additions requested: Update the file and confirm]

---

## Reflection

Let's pause and reflect on what you just did.

You:
- Read multiple files simultaneously
- Searched across all files for specific info
- Compared multiple sources
- Created organized summaries
- Generated executive-level analysis

All by asking me in natural language.

STOP: How does this compare to doing it manually?

USER: Response

[Acknowledge response]

In Module 3, we'll take this further with deep synthesis and strategic recommendations.
