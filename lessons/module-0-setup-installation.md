# Module 0: Setup & Installation - Interactive Lesson

Welcome! This lesson will verify your setup is complete and ready for the course.

If you're seeing this in Claude Code, you've already done most of the setup! Let's just verify everything is working correctly.

STOP: Ready to verify your setup?

USER: Yes / Ready / Let's go

---

## Step 1: Verify Your Location

Great! Let me check where we are.

ACTION: Run `pwd` to show current directory

You should be in the `student-files` folder (or whatever you named it).

STOP: Does the path end with your course folder name (like `student-files`)?

USER: Yes / Confirms location

[If no: Guide them to open the correct folder in their editor and restart Claude Code]

---

## Step 2: Verify Folder Structure

Let me check that all the course files are present.

ACTION: List all folders in the current directory

You should see these folders:
- `company-context/` - Company information
- `inherited-chaos/` - Scenario files
- `.claude/` - Commands and agents
- `organized/` - For your organized outputs
- `analysis/` - For your analysis work

STOP: Do you see all these folders?

USER: Yes / Confirms

[If missing folders: Direct them to re-download the course files]

---

## Step 3: Verify Commands Are Available

Let me check that the course commands are installed.

ACTION: List files in `.claude/commands/` folder

You should see:
- `start-module-1` through `start-module-7`
- Pre-built skills like `email-draft`, `meeting-notes`, etc.

STOP: Do you see the module commands and skills?

USER: Yes / Confirms

---

## Step 4: Verify Agents Are Available

Let me check the agent files.

ACTION: List files in `.claude/agents/` folder

You should see three agent files:
- `trainer-lead.md`
- `product-designer.md`
- `exec.md`

STOP: All three agents present?

USER: Yes / Confirms

---

## Step 5: Test File Reading

Let's make sure I can read files properly.

ACTION: Read `company-context/SCENARIO.md` and show the first few lines

STOP: Did you see information about FitHub Wellness and the FitRewards program?

USER: Yes / Confirms

---

## Step 6: Test File Creation

Let's verify I can create files.

ACTION: Create a test file called `setup-verified.md` with content:
```
# Setup Verified

✅ Claude Code is working correctly!
✅ Course files are in place
✅ Ready for Module 1

Setup verified on: [current date]
```

Done! Let me show you the file.

ACTION: Read back `setup-verified.md`

STOP: Does the file look correct?

USER: Yes / Confirms

---

## Setup Complete! ✅

Excellent! Your setup is fully verified:

✅ Claude Code is running
✅ You're in the correct project folder
✅ All course folders are present
✅ Commands and agents are available
✅ File reading works
✅ File creation works

**You're ready to start the course!**
