## Exercise 1: Multi-Perspective Decision Making

**Objective:** Practice getting diverse viewpoints on decisions.

**Tasks:**
1. Ask the Trainer Lead, Product Designer, and Exec: "Should FitHub add family membership tiers to FitRewards?"
2. Review each agent's perspective
3. Create a file called `decision-family-tiers.md` that:
   - Summarizes each agent's view
   - Identifies points of agreement and disagreement
   - Makes your final recommendation based on all perspectives

**Success Criteria:**
- All three agents provide distinct perspectives
- You understand the reasoning behind each view
- Your decision considers all viewpoints

## Exercise 2: Agent-Specific Deep Dives

**Objective:** Practice using agents for specialized analysis.

**Tasks:**
1. Ask the **Product Designer** to analyze all UX issues in customer feedback and create a prioritized fix list
2. Ask the **Trainer Lead** to review old campaigns and identify what trainers need to successfully promote FitRewards
3. Ask the **Exec** to analyze the ROI of the FitRewards program and recommend budget allocation

**Success Criteria:**
- Each agent produces analysis in their domain
- Recommendations are specific and actionable
- Each perspective reveals unique insights

## Exercise 3: Parallel Analysis

**Objective:** Practice running multiple agents simultaneously.

**Tasks:**
1. Give all three agents the same question: "What's the biggest problem with FitRewards and how would you fix it?"
2. Compare their answers
3. Create `multi-agent-analysis.md` showing:
   - What each agent identified as the main problem
   - Their proposed solutions
   - Where they agree
   - Where they conflict
   - Which perspective you find most compelling and why

**Success Criteria:**
- All three agents provide complete answers
- Comparison reveals different priorities
- You can articulate why perspectives differ

## Exercise 4: Create a Custom Agent

**Objective:** Practice designing and creating specialized agents.

**Tasks:**
1. Identify a perspective missing from the current agent team
   - Examples: Marketing Specialist, Data Analyst, Operations Manager, Member Advocate
2. Create a custom agent with:
   - Clear expertise and domain knowledge
   - Specific priorities and focus areas
   - How they approach problems
3. Test your agent with a FitHub question
4. Save their analysis

**Success Criteria:**
- Agent has distinct perspective from existing agents
- Agent provides valuable unique insights
- Agent is useful for recurring FitHub questions

## Exercise 5: Agent Orchestration

**Objective:** Practice coordinating multiple agents on complex projects.

**Tasks:**
Create a comprehensive improvement plan by orchestrating all agents:

1. **Trainer Lead:** Identify gym floor engagement opportunities
2. **Product Designer:** Create UX improvement roadmap
3. **Exec:** Build budget, timeline, and success metrics
4. **Your Custom Agent:** Add their specialized perspective
5. Synthesize all four into one `comprehensive-improvement-plan.md`

**Success Criteria:**
- Each agent contributes to their area of expertise
- Plan is comprehensive and actionable
- All perspectives are integrated, not just listed
- Plan could actually be implemented

---

## Exercise 6: Agent Debate

**Objective:** Practice having agents debate different approaches.

**Tasks:**
1. Have the Product Designer and Exec debate: "Should FitHub do a major app redesign or incremental improvements?"
2. Have them each make opening arguments
3. Have them respond to each other's points
4. Create `redesign-debate.md` capturing the full debate
5. Add your conclusion about which approach to take

**Success Criteria:**
- Both agents make strong arguments
- They address each other's concerns
- Debate reveals trade-offs and risks
- Your conclusion is informed by both sides

---

## Exercise 7: Context-Aware Agent Work

**Objective:** Practice giving agents project context.

**Tasks:**
1. Create an `agent-briefing.md` file that includes:
   - FitHub background and current situation
   - Key metrics and challenges
   - Decisions made so far
   - Constraints (budget, timeline)
2. Have each agent read the briefing before answering: "What should FitHub prioritize in the next 30 days?"
3. Compare answers with vs. without briefing

**Success Criteria:**
- Briefing provides meaningful context
- Agent answers are more specific with context
- Recommendations align with project constraints

---

## Exercise 8: Building Your Agent Team

**Objective:** Practice assembling the right team for different projects.

**Tasks:**
For each scenario, identify which 3 agents you'd use and why:

1. **Scenario A:** FitHub is considering launching a teen fitness program
2. **Scenario B:** Member retention has dropped 15% this quarter
3. **Scenario C:** Leadership wants to expand to a new state
4. **Scenario D:** App has critical bugs affecting user experience

Document your thinking in `agent-team-selection.md`

**Success Criteria:**
- Agent selection matches project needs
- You can explain why each agent adds value
- You identify when you might need to create new agents

---

## Bonus Challenge

**Real-World Agent Team:**

Think about a real project you're working on or might work on.

1. Design a team of 3-4 agents that would help with that project
2. Create at least one custom agent for your specific domain
3. Write agent briefing documents for your project
4. Test them on a real question from your work

Document the whole system in `my-project-agent-team.md`
