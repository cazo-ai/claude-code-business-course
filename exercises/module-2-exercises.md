## Exercise 1: Multi-File Reading

**Objective:** Practice reading multiple files simultaneously.

**Tasks:**
1. Ask Claude to read ALL customer feedback files (January through April) and identify recurring themes
2. Ask Claude to read ALL competitor research files and create a comparison chart
3. Ask Claude to read ALL old campaign files and identify which campaigns mentioned "points"

**Success Criteria:**
- Claude processes multiple files in one request
- You receive organized summaries across all files
- You can identify patterns that span multiple documents

## Exercise 2: Targeted Search

**Objective:** Practice searching for specific information across files.

**Tasks:**
1. Search for all mentions of "app" or "application" across all files
2. Search for all mentions of "trainer" or "training" across all files
3. Search for mentions of specific competitors (like "Planet Fitness") across all files

**Success Criteria:**
- You successfully find information in multiple locations
- You understand which files contain relevant information
- You can locate specific details quickly

## Exercise 3: Creating Organized Summaries

**Objective:** Practice creating structured reference documents.

**Tasks:**
1. Create a `competitor-summary.md` file that lists all competitors researched and their key features
2. Create a `feedback-themes.md` file that organizes member feedback into categories
3. Create a `campaign-timeline.md` that shows when each campaign ran

**Success Criteria:**
- Files are well-organized and easy to scan
- Information is accurately pulled from source files
- Summaries are useful as quick references

## Exercise 4: Comparative Analysis

**Objective:** Practice comparing information across sources.

**Tasks:**
1. Compare January feedback to April feedback - did member sentiment improve or worsen?
2. Compare FitHub's loyalty program to Planet Fitness and LA Fitness - what are the key differences?
3. Compare successful campaigns to unsuccessful ones - what patterns emerge?

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear differences are identified
- Evidence is cited from specific files
- Insights go beyond surface-level observation

---

## Exercise 5: Pattern Recognition

**Objective:** Practice finding hidden patterns in scattered data.

**Tasks:**
1. Identify the top 3 most common complaints across all feedback files
2. Find patterns in when members are most frustrated (beginning, middle, end of month?)
3. Identify which features members request most often

**Success Criteria:**
- Patterns are backed by evidence from multiple files
- You can rank issues by frequency/importance
- Findings could inform strategic decisions

## Exercise 6: Building an Inventory

**Objective:** Practice creating comprehensive reference documents.

**Tasks:**
Create an `inherited-files-inventory.md` that includes:
- All feedback files with date ranges
- All campaign files with brief descriptions
- All competitor research with key takeaways
- All company context files with their purpose

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete inventory of all inherited files
- Organized by category
- Useful as project navigation tool

---

## Bonus Challenge

**Advanced Multi-Source Analysis:**

Create a document called `engagement-problem-analysis.md` that synthesizes information from:
- Customer feedback files (what members say)
- Previous manager notes (what was tried)
- Campaign files (what was implemented)
- Competitor research (what others do better)

Your analysis should answer: What's really causing low engagement?
