   - Date and duration
   - What was analyzed
   - Key findings
   - Decisions made
   - Files created
   - Blockers or questions
   - Next session priorities
2. Fill out a session summary for your Module 6 work
3. Save it as `session-summary-[date].md`

## Exercise 5: Agent Context Document

**Objective:** Create project context for sub-agents.

**Tasks:**
Create an `agent-context.md` file that includes:
1. FitHub Wellness background
2. FitRewards program details and challenges
3. Current project phase and timeline
4. Key decisions made (reference decision log)
5. Budget and resource constraints
6. Success criteria
7. Important context agents should know

Test it by asking an agent to read it before answering a question.

**Success Criteria:**
- Context is comprehensive but concise
- Agents give better answers after reading it
- Information is organized logically
- Updated as project evolves

---

## Exercise 6: Progress Tracking System

**Objective:** Build a system to track project progress.

**Tasks:**
Create a `progress-tracker.md` file that includes:
1. 90-day timeline broken into phases
2. Key milestones for each phase
3. Work completed (with checkmarks)
4. Work in progress
5. Upcoming priorities
6. Blockers or risks
7. Success metrics tracking

**Success Criteria:**
- Timeline is realistic and specific
- Progress is honestly assessed
- Blockers are clearly identified
- Could be shared with leadership

---

## Exercise 7: Memory Continuity Test

**Objective:** Test that your memory system enables continuity.

**Tasks:**
1. Imagine you're starting a fresh Claude Code session tomorrow
2. Write down the exact prompts you'd use to get oriented:
   - What files would you ask Claude to read?
   - What questions would you ask?
   - How would you resume work?
3. Test this flow - close and reopen Claude, then follow your prompts
4. Document this as `session-startup-workflow.md`

**Success Criteria:**
- You can get fully oriented in under 5 minutes
- No information is lost between sessions
- Workflow is repeatable and efficient

---

## Exercise 8: Update Workflow Practice

**Objective:** Practice maintaining living documents.

**Tasks:**
1. Make a significant change to the project (simulate new data or decision)
2. Update all relevant memory files:
   - Add decision to decision log
   - Update project brief with new status
   - Add insight to knowledge base
   - Update progress tracker
   - Create session summary
3. Document what you updated and why

**Success Criteria:**
- All affected files are updated
- Updates are consistent across files
- New information is properly integrated
- Memory system stays current

---

## Exercise 9: Build a README

**Objective:** Create project navigation and onboarding document.

**Tasks:**
Create a `README.md` for the student-files folder that includes:
1. Project overview
2. Folder structure explanation
3. How to get started
4. Key documents and where to find them
5. How to use custom commands
6. How to work with agents
7. Memory file system explanation
8. Common workflows

**Success Criteria:**
- README is comprehensive onboarding document
- Someone new could get started independently
- All key resources are documented
- Navigation is clear and helpful

## Bonus Challenge

**Complete Memory System:**

Build a complete memory system for a real project:

1. Create all core memory files (brief, decision log, knowledge base, progress tracker)
2. Build session summary template
3. Create agent context document
4. Write project README
5. Document startup and shutdown workflows
6. Test the system across multiple "sessions"

This should be production-ready for an actual 90-day project.

## Final Course Challenge

**FitHub Turnaround Plan:**

Create your final deliverable: `fithub-turnaround-plan.md`

This comprehensive plan should synthesize everything you've learned across all 6 modules:

1. **Executive Summary** (5 bullet points max)
2. **Situation Analysis** - Current state with metrics
3. **Root Cause Analysis** - Why engagement is low
4. **Strategic Approach** - Overall strategy
5. **Specific Recommendations** (5-7 actionable items)
6. **Implementation Timeline** (90 days, broken into phases)
7. **Success Metrics** - How you'll measure progress
8. **Resource Requirements** - Budget, team, tools needed
9. **Risk Mitigation** - What could go wrong and how to prevent it
10. **Appendices** - Links to supporting analysis

This should be presentation-ready for FitHub leadership.
